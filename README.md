# Tron Lightcycle Battle

This project is a recreation of the classic arcade game TRON. It is developed using C++.
I made as a universitty project.

## Prerequisites

To run this game, you need a Windows operating system.

***NOTE***
__If you are using new **Windows Terminal**, consider switching to old **cmd** for better experience as it is not optimised for the new one__

## How to play

- Use the arrow keys to control your lightcycle.
- Avoid colliding with the walls and the trails left by your and your opponent's lightcycle.
- Try to trap your opponent and be the last one standing.

There are two modes
-**PVP** (player vs player) local multiplayer 
-**PVE** (player vs cpu) with 3 different AI difficulties


## Acknowledgements

- Thanks to the original creators of the TRON game for the inspiration.
